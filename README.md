#Test Task: Pokedex

Getting ready to Pokemon GO launch, it became obviously we need a source of info about pokemons. In order to do this, we need to create a client for http://pokeapi.co/

On click of ‘Load More’ another chunk of the list is being loaded and displayed on the page. Pokemon details should be displayed after clicking on the single pokemon in list. Previously shown pokemon details should disappear. 

Bonus points for implementing:
Adaptive styling (able to view this on all screen widths)
Filter visible pokemons by type

For this task you can use any css/js library/framework.
